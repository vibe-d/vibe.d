vibe.d
======

vibe.d is an asynchronous I/O and web application framework written in D.
It already contains many supplemental features such as database support
to be able to offer a complete development toolbox. Extensions are
supported in the form of [VPM modules](http://registry.vibed.org/).

Visit the website at <http://vibed.org/> for more information.


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

 - Install DMD using the installer on <http://dlang.org/download.html>
 - Unzip the vibe archive (or git clone) and add the bin/ subfolder to your PATH variable
 - Run any vibe apps using "vibe" from the application's root directory


Installation on Mac using brew
------------------------------

If you don't have brew installed, install it according to their [install
instructions](<https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation>) and
install libevent.

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"
    brew install libevent

(Note: Install brew only if you do not have macports, as they will conflict)
