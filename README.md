[![vibe.d](http://vibed.org/images/logo-and-title.png)](http://vibed.org)

vibe.d is a high-performance asynchronous I/O, concurrency and web application
toolkit written in D. It already contains many supplemental features such as
database support to be able to offer a complete development environment. For
more specialized needs, there are also many compatible
[DUB packages](http://code.dlang.org/?sort=updated&category=library.vibed)
available.

Visit the website at <http://vibed.org/> for more information.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rejectedsoftware/vibe.d.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rejectedsoftware/vibe.d)


Support
-------

Vibe.d aims to support the 3 latest minor releases of D.
At the moment, it means that the following compilers are supported and tested:
- DMD 2.068
- DMD 2.067
- DMD 2.066
- GDC 4.9.2 (FE: 2.066)
- LDC 0.15.1 (FE: 2.066)


Installation
------------

Instead of explicitly installing vibe.d, it is recommended to use
[DUB](https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/dub) for building vibe.d based
applications. Once DUB is installed, you can create and run a new project
using the following shell commands:

    dub init <name> vibe.d
    cd <name>
    dub

Similarly, you can run an example by invoking `dub` from any of the
example project directories.

Note that on non-Windows operating systems, you also need to have
libevent and OpenSSL installed - and of course a D compiler. See below
for instructions.


Additional setup on Windows
---------------------------

 - Just install DMD using the installer on <http://dlang.org/download.html>
 - And get the latest [DUB release](http://code.dlang.org/download)

### Note for building on Win64

There are currently no 64-bit Windows binaries of libevent included, so you'll either need to build those yourself, or you can switch to the "win32" event driver by inserting `"subConfigurations": {"vibe-d": "win32"}` into the dub.json file of your project.


Additional setup on Mac using brew
----------------------------------

If you don't have brew installed, install it according to their [install
instructions](<http://www.brew.sh>) and
install libevent.

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    brew install libevent

You can then also install DUB using brew:

    brew install dub

(Note: Install brew only if you do not have macports, as they will conflict)

Install DMD using the installer on <http://dlang.org/download.html>.

Optionally, run `./setup-mac.sh` to create a user/group pair for privilege lowering.


Additional setup on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)
----------------------------------------------

Install vibe.d's dependencies (*)

    sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libssl-dev


On 32-bit linux: Install DMD-i386

    sudo apt-get install g++ gcc-multilib xdg-utils
    wget "http://downloads.dlang.org/releases/2014/dmd_2.066.1-0_i386.deb"
    sudo dpkg -i dmd_2.066.1-0_i386.deb


On 64-bit linux: Install DMD-amd64

    sudo apt-get install g++ gcc-multilib xdg-utils
    wget "http://downloads.dlang.org/releases/2014/dmd_2.066.1-0_amd64.deb"
    sudo dpkg -i dmd_2.066.1-0_amd64.deb


Optionally, run `./setup-linux.sh` to create a user/group pair for privilege lowering.

(*) Note that Debian 6 (Squeeze) and older requires manual installation (see below).


Additional setup on Linux (generic)
-----------------------------------

You need to have the following dependencies installed:

 - [DMD 2.062 or greater](http://dlang.org/download)
 - [libssl](http://www.openssl.org/source/)
 - [libevent 2.0.x](http://libevent.org/) (*)

Optionally, run `./setup-linux.sh` to create a user/group pair for privilege lowering.

(*) Note that some Linux distributions such as Debian Squeeze or CentOS 6 may only ship libevent 1.4, in this case you will have to manually compile the latest 2.0.x version:

```
wget https://github.com/downloads/libevent/libevent/libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz
tar -xf libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz
cd libevent-2.0.21-stable
./configure
make
make install
ldconfig
```


Additional setup on FreeBSD
---------------------------

Install the DMD compiler and vibe.d's dependencies using portupgrade or a similar mechanism:

    sudo portupgrade -PN devel/libevent2 devel/pkgconf

Optionally, run `./setup-freebsd.sh` to create a user/group pair for privilege lowering.
