/**
	MongoDB and MongoCollection classes and connections.

	Implementation_Note:

	The MongoDB driver implementation here is missing a number of API functions
	known from the JavaScript driver, but these can usually be implemented in
	terms of MongoDatabase.runCommand or MongoCollection.find. Since the
	official documentation is lacking in some places, it may be necessary to use
	a network sniffer to monitor what exectly needs to be sent. MongoDB has a
	dedicated utility for this called $(LINK2 http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongosniff/ mongosniff).

/**
	Connects to a MongoDB instance.

	If the host/port form is used, default settings will be used, which enable
	safe updates, but no fsync. By specifying a URL instead, it is possible to
	fully customize the settings. See
	$(LINK http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Connections) for the complete set
	of options. Note that 'sslverifycertificate' is only present in some client
	bindings, including here.

	Note that the returned MongoClient uses a vibe.core.connectionpool.ConnectionPool
	internally to create and reuse connections as necessary. Thus, the
	MongoClient instance can - and should - be shared among all fibers in a
	thread by storing in in a thread local variable.

	Authentication:
		Authenticated connections are supported by using a URL connection string
		such as "mongodb://user:password@host". Note that the driver currently
		only supports the "MongoDB-CR" authentication mechanism. Since new
		MongoDB versions, starting with 3.0, default to the new "SCRAM-SHA-1"
		method, it is necessary to manually switch to the old method. See
		$(WEB http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29006887/mongodb-cr-authentication-failed)
		for more information.

	Examples:
		---
		// connecting with default settings:
		auto client = connectMongoDB("127.0.0.1");
		auto users = client.getCollection("users");
		users.insert(Bson("peter"));
		---

		---
		// connecting using the URL form with custom settings
		auto client = connectMongoDB("mongodb://localhost/?slaveOk=true");
		---

		---
		// connecting with SSL encryption enabled and verification off
		auto client = connectMongoDB("mongodb://localhost/?ssl=true&sslverifycertificate=false");
		---

	Params:
		host = Specifies the host name or IP address of the MongoDB server.
		port = Can be used to specify the port of the MongoDB server if different from the default one.
		host_or_url = Can either be a host name, in which case the default port will be used, or a URL with the mongodb:// scheme.

	Returns:
		A new MongoClient instance that can be used to access the database.

 	Throws:
 		Throws an exception if a mongodb:// URL is given and the URL cannot be parsed.
 		An exception will not be thrown if called with a hostname and port.
