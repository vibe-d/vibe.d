v0.7.20 - 2014-06-03
--------------------

The `vibe.web.web` web interface generator module has been extended with some important features, making it a full replacement (and more) of the old `registerFormInterface` functionality. Other important changes include the use of strong TLS ciphers out of the box, as well as a heavily optimized `URLRouter` implementation and support for compile-time localization of Diet templates.

### Features and improvements ###

 - Web interface generator and Diet template system
	- Added `vibe.web.web.terminateSession()` and `redirect()`
	- Added support for `struct` and array parameters, as well as `Nullable!T` in `vibe.web.web`
	- Added the `@errorDisplay` annotation to `vibe.web.web` to enable automatic exception display using an existing request handler
	- Added built-in, compile-time, gettext compatible localization support for Diet templates using the `tag& text` syntax

v0.7.16 - 2013-06-26
--------------------

This release finally features support for DMD 2.063. It also contains two breaking changes by removing support for the "vibe" script (aka VPM) and switching to an implicit task ownership model for streams (no more explicit acquire/release). It requires DUB 0.9.15 or later to build.

### Features and improvements ###

 - Fiber ownership of network connections and file streams is now handled implicitly to be more in line with classic blocking I/O and to lower the code overhead to share/pass connections between threads
 - Removed support for the "vibe" script (aka "VPM") in favor of DUB
 - Uses external Deimos packages instead of the included copies for binding to external C libraries
 - Improvements on the REST interface front (by Михаил Страшун aka Dicebot):
     - `registerRestInterface` deduces the base interface from a passed class instance
     - New overload of `registerRestInterface` for use with `@rootPath`
 - Added an overload of `handleWebSockets` that takes a function pointer
 - Improved documentation of `vibe.core.log` and re-enabled logging of date/time to plain text log files
 - Compiles with the release version of DMD 2.063 (various authors involved)
 - The idle handler is now called after processing all events in a spinning round after `yield()` call
 - Added `serveStaticFile` in addition to `serveStaticFiles` - [issue #227][issue227]
 - The thread/fiber ID is logged again by default if verbose logging is enabled

### Bug fixes ###

 - Fixed "INCR" and "DECR" methods in the Redis client - [issue #200][issue200], [issue #206][issue206]
 - Fixed the utility `HashMap` to properly call `GC.addRange` on manually allocated memory
 - Fixed erroneous crosstalk between multiple `ManualEvent` instances in the libevent driver
 - Fixed self-sending of messages to the caller in `vibe.core.concurrency`
 - Fixed syntax errors in the documentation of `URLRouter` - [issue #223][issue223]
 - Fixed calling the HTML logger from a thread that is not registered with the D runtime
 - Fixed `exitEventLoop` with no call to `enableWorkerThreads`, as well as when called from the idle handler
 - Fixed `HTTPServerRequest.path` to contain the URL-decoded version of the path - [issue #229][issue229]
 - Fixed `URLRouter` to not extract parameters of partial matches - [issue #230][issue230]
 - Fixed documentation example of `registerFormInterface`
 - Fixed lax indentation style checking in the Diet template compiler
 - Fixed unit tests for `parseMongoDBUrl` after the recently added support for digest authentication
 - Fixed construction of `Bson.Type.Regex` `Bson` objects (by Rene Zwanenburg) - [issue #238][issue238]
 - Fixed handling of Windows UNC paths - [See DUB issue #75][issue75dub]
 - Fixed the Redis methods taking varargs - [issue #234][issue234]
 - Fixed failure to free memory after an `SSLStream` has failed to initiate the tunnel

v0.7.15 - 2013-04-27
--------------------

This release cleans up the API in several places (scheduling some symbols for deprecation) and largely improves the multi-threading primitives. It also features initial support for Win64 and a revamped logging system, as well as authentication support for the MongoDB client and a lot of smaller enhancements.

 - All examples now use exact imports rather than using `import vibe.vibe;` or `import vibe.d;`
 - Moved basic WWW form parsing from `vibe.http.form` to `vibe.inet.webform` to reduce intermodule dependencies and improve compile time
 - MongoDB URL parsing code uses `vibe.inet.webform` to parse query string arguments now instead of `std.regex` - improves compile time

 - Updated OpenSSL DLLs to 1.0.1e (important security fixes)
 - Renamed `EventedObject.isOwner` to `amOwner`

v0.7.14 - 2013-03-22
--------------------

A lot has been improved on the performance and multi-threading front. The HTTP server benchmark jumped from around 17k req/s up to 48k req/s on a certain quad-core test system and >10k connections can now be handled at the same time (on 64-bit systems due to virtual memory requirements).

### Features and improvements ###

 - Performance tuning for the HTTP server and client
 - Implemented distributed listening and HTTP server request processing (using worker threads to accept connections)
 - Stable memory usage for HTTP client and server (tested for 50 million requests)
 - Implemented new `TaskMutex` and `TaskCondition` classes deriving from Druntime's `Mutex` and `Condition` for drop-in replacement
 - Added a simplified version of the `std.concurrency` API that works with vibe.d's tasks (temporary drop-in replacement)

 - Added `Json.remove()` for JSON objects
 - Added `Isolated!T` in preparation of a fully thread-safe API
 - The package description now exposes a proper set of configurations
 - VPM uses the new download URL schema instead of relying on a `"downloadUrl"` field in the package description to stay forward compatible with DUB
 - The default order to listen is now IPv6 and then IPv4 to avoid the IPv4 listener blocking the IPv6 one on certain systems
 - Added `HttpServerSettings.disableDistHost` to force `listenHttp` to listen immediately, even during initialization
 - Added `WebSocket.receiveBinary` and `WebSocket.receiveText` - [issue #182][issue182]
 - Added `HttpServerResponse.writeRawBody` and `HttpClientResponse.readRwaBody` to allow for verbatim forwarding
 - ".gz" and ".tgz" are now recognized as compressed formats and are not transferred with a compressed "Content-Encoding"
 - Added a pure scoped callback based version of `requestHttp` to allow GC-less operation and also automatic pipelining of requests in the future

### Bug fixes ###

 - Fixed some possible crashes and memory leaks in the `HttpClient`
 - Fixed the `HttpRouter` interface to derive from `HttpServerRequestHandler`
 - Fixed parsing of version ranges in the deprecated VPM
 - Fixed some examples by added a `VibeCustomMain` version to their package.json
