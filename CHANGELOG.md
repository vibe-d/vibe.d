v0.8.0 - 2017-07-10
-------------------

The 0.8.x branch marks the final step before switching each individual sub package to version 1.0.0. This has already been done for the Diet template module (now [`diet-ng`][diet-ng]) and for the new [vibe-core][vibe-core] package that is released simultaneously. The most prominent changes in this release are a full separation of all sub modules into individual folders, as well as the use of `@safe` annotations throughout the code base. The former change may require build adjustments for projects that don't use DUB to build vibe.d, the latter leads to some breaking API changes.

### Features and improvements ###

- Compiles on DMD 2.070.2 up to DMD 2.075.0-b1, this release also adds support for `-m32mscoff` builds ("x86_mscoff")
- Global API changes
    - Split up the library into fully separate sub packages/folders
    - Added a "vibe-core" configuration to "vibe-d" and "vibe-d:core" that uses the new [vibe-core][vibe-core] package
    - Added `@safe` and `nothrow` annotations in many places of the API - this is a breaking change in cases where callbacks were annotated - [pull #1618][issue1618], [issue 1595][issue1595]
    - Reworked the buffered I/O stream API
        - The `InputStream` based overload of `OutputStream.write` has been moved to a global function `pipe()`
        - `read` and `write` now accept an optional `IOMode` parameter (only `IOMode.all` is supported for the original `vibe:core`, but `vibe-core` supports all modes)
        - `InputStream.leastSize` and `.dataAvailableForRead` are scheduled for deprecation - `IOMode.immediate` and `IOMode.once` can be used in their place
    - Added forward compatibility code to "vibe:core" so that dependent code can use either that or [vibe-core][vibe-core] as a drop-in replacement
- HTTP server
    - Server contexts are now managed thread-locally, which means that multiple threads will attempt to listen on the same port if requested to do so - use `HTTPServerOption.reusePort` if necessary
    - Added support for simple range queries in the HTTP file server (by Jan Jurzitza aka WebFreak001) - [issue #716][issue716], [pull #1634][issue1634], [pull #1636][issue1636]

        - Usability improvements by Harry T. Vennik aka thaven - [pull #1745][issue1745]
    - Added `checkBasicAuth` as a non-enforcing counterpart of `performBasicAuth` - [issue #1449][issue1449], [pull #1687][issue1687]
    - Diet templates are rendered as pretty HTML by default if "diet-ng" is used (can be disabled using `VibeOutputCompactHTML`) - [issue #1616][issue1616]
    - Added `HTTPClientRequest.writeFormBody`
    - Disabled stack traces on the default error page for non-debug builds by default (`HTTPServerOption.defaults`)
- REST interface generator
    - Added single-argument `@bodyParam` to let a single parameter represent the whole request body (by Sebastian Wilzbach) - [issue #1549][issue1549], [pull #1723][issue1723]
    - Boolean parameters now accept "1" and case insensitive "true" as `true` - [pull #1712][issue1712]
    - Server responses now output prettified JSON if built in debug mode
    - Stack traces are only written in debug mode - [issue #1623][issue1623]
    - Reduced the number of chunks written by `StreamOutputRange.put` for large input buffers (affects WebSockets and chunked HTTP responses)
- Switched to `std.experimental.allocator` instead of the integrated `vibe.utils.memory` module
- The string sequence `</` is now encoded as `<\/` by the JSON module to avoid a common XSS attack vector
- Reduced synchronization overhead in the libevent driver for entities that are single-threaded
- Added support for MongoDB SCRAM-SHA1 authentication (by Nicolas Gurrola) - [pull #1632][issue1632]
- Added `RedisCollection.initialize`

- Enabled minimal delegate syntax for `URLRouter` (e.g. `URLRouter.get("/", (req, res) { ... });`) - [issue #1668][issue1668]
- Added serialization support for string based enum types as associative array keys (by Tomoya Tanjo) - [issue #1660][issue1660], [pull #1663][issue1663]
- Added serialization support for `Typedef!T` - [pull #1617][issue1617]
- Added `DictionaryList!T.byKeyValue` to replace `opApply` based iteration
- Added `.byValue`/`.byKeyValue`/`.byIndexValue` properties to `Bson` and `Json` as a replacement for `opApply` based iteration (see [issue #1688][issue1688])
- Added `StreamOutputRange.drop()`
- Updated the Windows OpenSSL binaries to 1.0.2k
- The session life time in `RedisSessionStore` is now refreshed on every access to the session (by Steven Schveighoffer) - [pull #1778][issue1778]

### Features and improvements ###

- General changes
  - Compiles on DMD 2.068.2 up to 2.072.0
  - Added `runApplication` as a single API entry point to properly initialize and run a vibe.d application (this will serve as the basis for slowly phasing out the `VibeDefaultMain` convenience mechanism)

  - Added `vibe.web.auth` as a generic way to express authorization rules and to provide a common hook for authentication
  - Added `@noRoute` attribute for `registerWebInterface` to keep methods from generating a HTTP endpoint
  - Added `@nestedNameStyle` to choose between the classical underscore mapping and D style mapping for form parameter names in `registerWebInterface`
- Serialization framework

v0.7.28 - 2016-02-27
--------------------

This is a hotfix release, which fixes two critical regressions. The first one resulted in memory leaks or memory corruption, while the second one could cause TCP connections to hang indefinitely in the `close` method for the libevent driver.

### Bug fixes ###

- Fixed a regression in `FreeListRef` which caused the reference count to live outside of the allocated memory bounds - [issue #1432][issue1432]
- Fixed a task starvation regression in the libevent driver that happened when a connection got closed by the TCP remote peer while there was still data in the write buffer - [pull #1443][issue1443], [issue #1441][issue1441]
- Fixed recognizing "Connection: close" headers for non-lowercase spelling of "close" - [issue #1426][issue1426]
- Fixed the UDP receive timeout to actually work in the libevent driver - [issue #1429][issue1429]
- Fixed handling of the "Connection" header in the HTTP server to be case insensitive - [issue #1426][issue1426]

v0.7.27 - 2016-02-09
--------------------

In preparation for a full separation of the individual library components, this release splits up the code logically into multiple DUB sub packages. This enables dependent code to reduce the dependency footprint and compile times. In addition to this and a bunch of further improvements, a lot of performance tuning and some important REST interface additions went into this release.

Note that the integration code for `std.concurrency` has been re-enabled with this release. This means that you can use `std.concurrency` without worrying about blocking the event loop now. However, there are a few incompatibilities between `std.concurrency` and vibe.d's own version in `vibe.core.concurrency`, such as `std.concurrency` not supporting certain `shared(T)` or `Isolated!T` to be passed to spawned tasks. If you hit any issues that cannot be easily resolved, the usual vibe.d behavior is available in the form of "Compat" suffixed functions (i.e. `sendCompat`, `receiveCompat` etc.). But note that these functions operate on separate message queue structures, so mixing the "Compat" functions with non-"Compat" versions will not work.

### Features and improvements ###

- Compiles on DMD frontend versions 2.066.0 up to 2.070.0
- Split up the library into sub packages - this prepares for a deeper split that is going to happen in the next release
- A lot of performance tuning went into the network and HTTP code, leading to a 50% increase in single-core HTTP performance and a lot more in the multi-threaded case over 0.7.26
- Marked more of the API `@safe` and `nothrow`
- Re-enabled the `std.concurrency` integration that went MIA a while ago - `std.concurrency` can now be used transparently in vibe.d applications - [issue #1343][issue1343], [pull #1345][issue1345]
- REST interface generator changes
  - Added support for REST collections with natural D syntax using the new `Collection!I` type - [pull #1268][issue1268]
  - Implemented CORS support for the REST interface server (by Sebastian Koppe) - [pull #1299][issue1299]
  - Conversion errors for path parameters (e.g. `@path("/foo/:someparam")`) in REST interfaces now result in a 404 error instead of 500
- HTTP server/client changes
  - The `URLRouter` now adds a `"routerRootDir"` entry with the relative path to the router base directory to `HTTPServerRequest.params` (by Steven Dwy) - [pull #1301][issue1301]
  - Added a WebSocket client implementation (by Kemonozume) - [pull #1332][issue1332]
  - Added the possibility to access cookie contents as a raw string
  - The HTTP client now retries a request if a keep-alive connection gets closed before the response gets read

  - Added `scope` callback based overloads of `switchProtocol` in `HTTPServerResponse` and `HTTPClientResponse`
  - Added `ChunkedOutputStream.chunkExtensionCallback` to control HTTP chunk-extensions (by Manuel Frischknecht and Yannick Koechlin) - [pull #1340][issue1340]

- Added `getMarkdownOutline`, which returns a tree of sections in a Markdown document
- Added `Path.relativeToWeb`, a version of `relativeTo` with web semantics

v0.7.25 - 2015-09-20
--------------------

Mostly a bugfix release, including a regression fix in the web form parser, this release also drops official support for the DMD 2.065.0 front end (released February 2014). Most functionality will probably still stay functional on 2.065.0 for a while.

v0.7.24 - 2015-08-10
--------------------

Adds DMD 2.068.0 compatibility and contains a number of additions and fixes in all parts of the library. Some notable changes are the addition of WebSocket support in the `vibe.web.web` module and the planned deprecation of `opDispatch` for `Json` and `Bson`, as well as the rename of all "SSL" symbols to "TLS". HTTP request handlers can, and should, now take the request/response parameters as `scope`, which will later allow to improve performance without compromising safety.

### Features and improvements ###

 - Web interface generator (`vibe.web.web`)
   - Added support for `WebSocket` routes - [issue #952][issue952]
   - Doesn't intercept `HTTPStatusException`s thrown during parameter assembly anymore
   - Replaced the deprecated form interface example project with a `vibe.web.web` based "web_ajax" example
   - Added support for the `@path` attribute on registered classes - [issue #1036][issue1036]

   - Removed support for `index()` methods (use `get()` or `@path("/")`) (by Mathias Lang) - [pull #1010][issue1010]
   - Deprecated the `@rootPath` attribute (use `@path` instead) (by Mathias Lang) - [pull #999][issue999]

 - Added `Bson.tryIndex` (by Marc Schütz) - [pull #1032][issue1032]
 - Added support for all standard HTTP methods (RFC) (by Szabo Bogdan) - [pull #1068][issue1068], [pull #1082][issue1082]
 - Added overloads for `scope` based HTTP server callbacks
   - These will later be used for safe, allocation-less HTTP request processing
   - Always prefer this over the non-`scope` callbacks, as these will imply a performance impact in later versions
 - Added `vibe.core.stream.nullSink` as a convenient way to get a generic data sink stream
 - Added overloads of `writeFormData` and `writeFormBody` that accept ranges of key/value tuples (by Tobias Pankrath)
 - Added `HTTPClientResponse.switchProtocol` (by Luca Niccoli) - [pull #945][issue945]

 - Added a `ConnectionProxyStream` constructor taking separate input and output streams
 - Updated the OpenSSL Windows binaries to 1.0.1m
 - Added `BigInt` support to the JSON module (by Igor Stepanov) - [pull #1118][issue1118]
 - The event loop of the win32 driver can now be stopped by sending a `WM_QUIT` message (by Денис Хлякин aka aka-demik) - [pull #1120][issue1120]
 - Marked `vibe.inet.path` as `pure` and removed casts that became superfluous
 - Added an `InputStream` based overload of `HTTPServerResponse.writeBody` - [issue #1594][issue1594]

v0.7.23 - 2015-03-25
--------------------

Apart from fixing compilation on DMD 2.067 and revamping the `vibe.core.sync` module to support `nothrow`, notable changes are extended parameter support in `vibe.web.rest`, improved translation support in `vibe.web.web` and new support for policy based customization of (de-)serialization. The Diet template parser has also received a good chunk of fixes and improvements in this release.

v0.7.20 - 2014-06-03
--------------------

The `vibe.web.web` web interface generator module has been extended with some important features, making it a full replacement (and more) of the old `registerFormInterface` functionality. Other important changes include the use of strong TLS ciphers out of the box, as well as a heavily optimized `URLRouter` implementation and support for compile-time localization of Diet templates.

### Features and improvements ###

	- Added built-in, compile-time, gettext compatible localization support for Diet templates using the `tag& text` syntax
 - HTTP router
	- Implemented a new match tree based routing algorithm for `URLRouter`, resulting in great speedups for complex routing setups
	- Added `URLRouter.prefix` to configure a prefix to append to every route
	- The `HTTPRouter` router interface is scheduled for removal

	- Added `@asArray` to force serialization of composite types as arrays instead of dictionaries
	- Added support for using a pre-allocated buffer for `serializeToBson`
	- Added support for custom serialization representations of user defined types using `toRepresentation`/`fromRepresentation` methods - [issue #618][issue618]
	- Made `DictionaryList` serializable as an array by adding `toRepresentation`/`fromRepresentation` - [issue #621][issue621]
 - SSL/TLS
	- Using only strong ciphers by default for SSL server contexts
	- Added out-of-the box support for perfect forward secrecy (PFS) (by Martin Nowak) - [pull #630][issue630]
	- Changed the default from `SSLVersion.tls1` (fixed TLS 1.0) to `SSLVersion.any` (SSL 3 and up, including TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2)
	- Added `SMTPClientSettings.sslContextSetup` to enable customization of the SSL context (e.g. adding trusted certificates)
	- Upgraded the Windows OpenSSL binaries to 1.0.1g
 - Performance tuning
	- Added `HTTPServerOption.errorStackTraces` to make costly stack trace generation optional
	- Arguments to the logging functions are now evaluated lazily to avoid computations when messages are not actually logged

	- Added `vibe.core.file.readFile`, `readFileUTF8`, `writeFile` and `writeFileUTF8`
	- Added a limited overload of `RedisDatabase.zrevRangeByScore` and fix the type of the `start`/`end` parameters (by Jens K. Mueller) - [pull #637][issue637]
	- Added `TCPListenOptions.disableAutoClose` to make incoming TCP connections independent of the initial handler task
	- Added `vibe.core.concurrency.thisTid` as an alias to `Task.getThis()` for improved API compatibility to `std.concurrency`
	- Added an overload of `UDPConnection.recv` taking a timeout parameter - [issue #540][issue540]
	- Added `toString` to `HTTPRequest` and `HTTPResponse` for convenient logging
	- Added `MarkdownSettings` with additional support of setting the base heading level of the generated HTML
	- Added `TCPConnection.keepAlive` to set the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option - [issue #622][issue622]
	- `Error` derived exceptions are not caught anymore (use `-version=VibeDebugCatchAll` to get the old unsafe behavior)
	- Annotated some basic modules with `@safe`/`@trusted`/`pure`
	- Extended `ProxyStream` to optionally take distinct streams for input and output
	- Replaced all remaining uses of `renderCompat` with `render`
	- Removed unused variables and made `Bson.toString` `const` (thanks to Brian Schott aka Hackerpilot) - [issue #659][issue659]

v0.7.16 - 2013-06-26
--------------------

This release finally features support for DMD 2.063. It also contains two breaking changes by removing support for the "vibe" script (aka VPM) and switching to an implicit task ownership model for streams (no more explicit acquire/release). It requires DUB 0.9.15 or later to build.

### Features and improvements ###

 - Fiber ownership of network connections and file streams is now handled implicitly to be more in line with classic blocking I/O and to lower the code overhead to share/pass connections between threads
 - Removed support for the "vibe" script (aka "VPM") in favor of DUB
 - Uses external Deimos packages instead of the included copies for binding to external C libraries
 - Improvements on the REST interface front (by Михаил Страшун aka Dicebot):
     - `registerRestInterface` deduces the base interface from a passed class instance
     - New overload of `registerRestInterface` for use with `@rootPath`
 - Added an overload of `handleWebSockets` that takes a function pointer
 - Improved documentation of `vibe.core.log` and re-enabled logging of date/time to plain text log files
 - Compiles with the release version of DMD 2.063 (various authors involved)
 - The idle handler is now called after processing all events in a spinning round after `yield()` call
 - Added `serveStaticFile` in addition to `serveStaticFiles` - [issue #227][issue227]
 - The thread/fiber ID is logged again by default if verbose logging is enabled

### Bug fixes ###

 - Fixed "INCR" and "DECR" methods in the Redis client - [issue #200][issue200], [issue #206][issue206]
 - Fixed the utility `HashMap` to properly call `GC.addRange` on manually allocated memory
 - Fixed erroneous crosstalk between multiple `ManualEvent` instances in the libevent driver
 - Fixed self-sending of messages to the caller in `vibe.core.concurrency`
 - Fixed syntax errors in the documentation of `URLRouter` - [issue #223][issue223]
 - Fixed calling the HTML logger from a thread that is not registered with the D runtime
 - Fixed `exitEventLoop` with no call to `enableWorkerThreads`, as well as when called from the idle handler
 - Fixed `HTTPServerRequest.path` to contain the URL-decoded version of the path - [issue #229][issue229]
 - Fixed `URLRouter` to not extract parameters of partial matches - [issue #230][issue230]
 - Fixed documentation example of `registerFormInterface`
 - Fixed lax indentation style checking in the Diet template compiler
 - Fixed unit tests for `parseMongoDBUrl` after the recently added support for digest authentication
 - Fixed construction of `Bson.Type.Regex` `Bson` objects (by Rene Zwanenburg) - [issue #238][issue238]
 - Fixed handling of Windows UNC paths - [See DUB issue #75][issue75dub]
 - Fixed the Redis methods taking varargs - [issue #234][issue234]
 - Fixed failure to free memory after an `SSLStream` has failed to initiate the tunnel

v0.7.15 - 2013-04-27
--------------------

This release cleans up the API in several places (scheduling some symbols for deprecation) and largely improves the multi-threading primitives. It also features initial support for Win64 and a revamped logging system, as well as authentication support for the MongoDB client and a lot of smaller enhancements.

### Features and improvements ###
 
 - Improved the logging system with pluggable loggers, more specified verbose log levels, an HTML logger, and proper use of stdout/stderr
 - Added basic compile support for 64-bit Windows (using the "win32" driver)
 - Add a scoped alternative version of `vibe.core.concurrency.lock` (used for safe access to `shared` objects with unshared methods)
 - Add support to repeat the idle event until a new message arrives
 - Task is now weakly isolated and can thus be passed to other threads using `runWorkerTask`
 - Implemented digest authentication in the MongoDB client (by Christian Schneider aka HowToMeetLadies) - [pull #218][issue218]
 - The number of worker threads is now `core.cpuid.threadsPerCPU`
 - `TaskMutex` is now fully thread safe and has much lower overhead when no contention happens

v0.7.7 - 2012-08-05
-------------------

Brings some general improvements and DMD 2.060 compatibility.

### Features and improvements ###

 - Compiles with DMD 2.060 - [issue #70][issue70]
 - Some considerable improvements and fixes for the REST interface generator - it is now also actually used and tested in another project
 - MongoDB supports `mongodb://` URLs for specifying various connection settings instead of just host/port (by David Eagen) - [issue #80][issue80], [issue #81][issue81]
 - Added `RestInterfaceClient.requestFilter` to enable authentication and similar add-on functionality
 - JSON floating-point numbers are now stringified with higher precision
 - Improved const-correctness if the Bson struct (by cybevnm) - [issue #77][issue77]
 - Added `setIdleHandler()` to enable tasks that run when all events have been processed
 - Putting a '{' at the end of a D statement in a Diet template instead of using indentation for nesting will now give an error
 - API documentation improvements

### Bug Fixes ### 

 - The HTTP server now allows query strings that are not valid forms - [issue #73][issue73]

v0.7.6 - 2012-07-15
-------------------

The most important improvements are easier setup on Linux and Mac and an important bug fix for TCP connections. Additionally, a lot of performance tuning - mostly reduction of memory allocations - has been done.

### Features and improvements ###
 
 - A good amount of performance tuning of the HTTP server
 - Implemented `vibe.core.core.yield()`. This can be used to break up long computations into smaller parts to reduce latency for other tasks
 - Added setup-linux.sh and setup-mac.sh scripts that set a symlink in /usr/bin and a configuration file in /etc/vibe (Thanks to Jordi Sayol)
 - Installed VPM modules are now passed as version identifiers "VPM_package_xyz" to the application to allow for optional features
 - Improved serialization of structs/classes to JSON/BSON - properties are now serialized and all non-field/property members are now ignored
 - Added directory handling functions to `vibe.core.file` (not using asynchronous operations, yet)
 - Improved the vibe shell script's compatibility

### Bug fixes ###
 
 - Fixed `TcpConnection.close()` for the libevent driver - this caused hanging page loads in some browsers
 - Fixed MongoDB connection handling to avoid secondary assertions being triggered in case of exceptions during the communication
 - Fixed JSON (de)serialization of structs and classes (member names were wrong) - [issue #72][issue72]
 - Fixed `(filter)urlEncode` for character values < 0x10 - [issue #65][issue65]

v0.7.5 - 2012-06-05
-------------------

This is a maintainance release primaily to make the examples work again and to improve permission issues when vibe is installed in a read-only location.

 - Restructured the examples - each example is now a regular vibe.d application (also fixes compilation using run_example)
 - The REST interface generator now supports sub interfaces which are mapped to sub paths in the URL
 - Added `InjectedParams!()` to access parameters injected using inject!()
 - The vibe script and VPM now do not write to the application directory anymore if not necessary
 - Implement more robust type handling in the REST client generator
 - Fixed a possible exception in `ZlibInputStream` at the end of the stream


v0.7.4 - 2012-06-03
-------------------

 - Added support for multipart/form-data and file uploads
 - Rewrote the Markdown parser - it now does not emit paragraphs inside list elements if no blank lines are present and handles markdown nested in quotes properly
 - The SMTP client supports STARTTLS and PLAIN/LOGIN authentication
 - The Diet parser now supports generic `:filters` using `registerDietTextFilter()` - `:css`, `:javascript` and `:markdown` are already built-in
 - VPM now can automatically updates dependencies and does not query the registry at every run anymore
 - Added `vibe.templ.utils.inject` which allows to flexibly stack together request processors and inject variables into the final HTML template (thanks to simendsjo for the kick-off implementation)
 - Removed `InputStream.readAll()` and `readLine()` and replaced them by UFCS-able global functions + added `readUntil()`
 - Added `ConnectionPool` to generically manage reuse of persistent connections (e.g. for databases)
 - The `HttpClient` (and thus the reverse proxy) now uses a connection pool to avoid continuous reconnects
 - On *nix now uses pkg-config to find linker dependencies if possible (dawgfoto) - [issue #52][issue52]
 - The static HTTP file server now resolves paths with '.' and '..' instead of simply refusing them
 - Implemented handling of `HttpServerSettings.maxRequestTime`
 - Added `setLogFile()`
 - The vibe.cmd script now works with paths containing spaces
 - `Libevent2TcpConnection` now enforces proper use of `acquire()/release()`
 - Improved stability in conjunction with TCP connections
 - Upgraded libevent to 2.0.19 on Windows
