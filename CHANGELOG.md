-------------------

### Features and improvements ###

 - Compiles with DMD 2.060 - [issue #70][issue70]
 - Some considerable improvements and fixes for the REST interface generator - it is now also actually used and tested in another project
 - MongoDB supports `mongodb://` URLs for specifying various connection settings instead of just host/port (by David Eagen) - [issue #80][issue80], [issue #81][issue81]
 - Added `RestInterfaceClient.requestFilter` to enable authentication and similar add-on functionality
 - JSON floating-point numbers are now stringified with higher precision
 - Improved const-correctness if the Bson struct (by cybevnm) - [issue #77][issue77]
 - Added `setIdleHandler()` to enable tasks that run when all events have been processed
 - Putting a '{' at the end of a D statement in a Diet template instead of using indentation for nesting will now give an error
 - API documentation improvements

### Bug Fixes ### 

 - The HTTP server now allows query strings that are not valid forms - [issue #73][issue73]

v0.7.6 - 2012-07-15
-------------------

### Features and improvements ###
 
 - A good amount of performance tuning of the HTTP server
 - Implemented `vibe.core.core.yield()`. This can be used to break up long computations into smaller parts to reduce latency for other tasks
 - Added setup-linux.sh and setup-mac.sh scripts that set a symlink in /usr/bin and a config file in /etc/vibe (Thanks to Jordi Sayol)
 - Installed VPM modules are now passed as version identifiers "VPM_package_xyz" to the application to allow for optional features
 - Improved serialization of structs/classes to JSON/BSON - properties are now serialized and all non-field/property members are now ignored
 - Added directory handling functions to `vibe.core.file` (not using asynchronous operations, yet)
 - Improved the vibe shell script's compatibility

### Bug fixes ###
 
 - Fixed `TcpConnection.close()` for the libevent driver - this caused hanging page loads in some browsers
 - Fixed MongoDB connection handling to avoid secondary assertions being triggered in case of exceptions during the communication
 - Fixed JSON (de)serialization of structs and classes (member names were wrong) - [issue #72][issue72]
 - Fixed `(filter)urlEncode` for character values < 0x10 - [issue #65][issue65]

v0.7.5 - 2012-06-05
-------------------

 - Restructured the examples - each example is now a regular vibe.d application (also fixes compilation using run_example)
 - The REST interface generator now supports sub interfaces which are mapped to sub paths in the URL
 - Added `InjectedParams!()` to access parameters injected using inject!()
 - The vibe script and VPM now do not write to the application directory anymore if not necessary
 - Implement more robust type handling in the REST client generator
 - Fixed a possible exception in `ZlibInputStream` at the end of the stream


v0.7.4 - 2012-06-03
-------------------

 - Added support for multipart/form-data and file uploads
 - Rewrote the Markdown parser - it now does not emit paragraphs inside list elements if no blank lines are present and handles markdown nested in quotes properly
 - The SMTP client supports STARTTLS and PLAIN/LOGIN authentication
 - The Diet parser now supports generic :filters using `registerDietTextFilter()` - :css, :javascript and :markdown are already built-in
 - VPM now can automatically updates dependencies and does not query the registry at every run anymore
 - Added `vibe.templ.utils.inject` which allows to flexibly stack together request processors and inject variables into the final HTML template (thanks to simendsjo for the kick-off implementation)
 - Removed `InputStream.readAll()` and `readLine()` and replaced them by UFCS-able global functions + added `readUntil()`
 - Added `ConnectionPool` to generically manage reuse of persistent connections (e.g. for databases)
 - The `HttpClient` (and thus the reverse proxy) now uses a connection pool to avoid continuous reconnects
 - On *nix now uses pkg-config to find linker dependencies if possible (dawgfoto) - [issue #52][issue52]
 - The static HTTP file server now resolves paths with '.' and '..' instead of simply refusing them
 - Implemented handling of `HttpServerSettings.maxRequestTime`
 - Added `setLogFile()`
 - The vibe.cmd script now works with paths containing spaces
 - `Libevent2TcpConnection` now enforces proper use of `acquire()/release()`
 - Improved stability in conjunction with TCP connections
 - Upgraded libevent to 2.0.19 on Windows
