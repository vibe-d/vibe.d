HTTP
====

 - defer writing the header of server responses to the second written chunk in case of using bodyWriter() - if only one chunk is ever written, write non-chunked instead
 - implement generators for http.rest to "documentation" with all possible requests.
 - support pipelining for HttpClient

TCP
===

 - Keep a live count of all event objects in the libevent2 driver and exit as soon as the count drops to zero
 - Add a DoS barrier that closes old connections in case of high connection counts (e.g. Slowloris attack)

GENERAL
=======

 - Asynchronous file I/O (already works for Win32)
 - Load balancer with support for seemless recompile (vibedist)
 - Use the event_set_*_callback functions to log libevent messages
 - Analyze all code for memory leaks (e.g. SSLContext)
 - HTTP server comparison to nginx
 - Mention the API used for Diet templates on the /templates page
 - Implement a soft-shutdown in case of catching an Error (in conjunction with vibedist)
 - Document the different -version specifiers that are possible
